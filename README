This project contains some utilities that can be useful when you deal with MySQL administration.

-dbCopy.sh:
    A simple tool to replicate databases in MySQL instances or servers.
    It's quite useful for really big tables, due to it doesn't use any temporary disk space (it use a pipe to move the data). It uses a CSV export and import mecanism instead of standard MySQL backup utility, and this increases significantly the performance.
