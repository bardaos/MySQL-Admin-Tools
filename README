This project contains some little utilities that can be useful when you have to administer MySQL servers.

-dbCopy.sh:
    This tools can replicate databases in different MySQL instances or servers.
    It's quite useful for really big databases, due to it doesn't use any temporary disk space (it use a pipe to move the data) and instead of use directly the MySQL backup utility, it use a CSV export and import mecanism, that increase significantly the performance.
